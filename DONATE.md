If you like this project and would like to see continued development of projects like this one, please make an <i>optional</i> monitary donation to my bank account.
## How to Donate...

### What will the donated money be used for?
Starting off, I wish to upgrade my GitHub account, but I don't have money to do that!<br>
Next, I wish to buy a domain name, but I don't have money to do that!<br>
I wish to set up a website <i>without</i> advertisements, but, again, I have no money to do that.<br>
Also, I wish to set up an FTP site, for public and private use, and again, I do not have any money to make that happen.
### Donations are <i>OPTIONAL!</i>
Yes, donations are <b><i>purely OPTIONAL</b></i>!
#### What happens when nobody donates?
Well, I continue playing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.pacmantournaments" target="_new">Bandai Namco PAC-MAN</a> game on my Android tablet.
#### What happens when I receive insufficient donations?
Well, I begin reducing the development work I post online and I continue playing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.pacmantournaments" target="_new">Bandai Namco PAC-MAN</a> game on my Android tablet.
### Why donate?
Good question for many, especially to those that don't know me. I am a <b><i>disabled</i> person (PWD)</b> and have been since 2003. My disabilities are <i>invisible</i> and I look like a normal person, however, I suffer in extreme pain, all the time, and I have medical conditions that prevent me from gaining employment. I am originally from the USA; the disability money I receive is <i>insufficient</i> to pay for my hobbies. I am a <i>veteran</i> programmer of the C programming language (since 1989). MirandaSoft was a computer business I ran in Northwestern USA from 1992 to 2006; it has been a defunct business since 2006 but remains the <i>codename</i> of my technical hobbies.
